# Contributing

If you're contributing to this project, there's a 100% chance you're one of just a few people, all of whom know each other.

However, let's try to keep things clean and orderly. To make sure everyone is following the same rules, all contributions/etc. should follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). This means that each time noteworthy changes are made, the process should include:

* **Creating a branch**
  * Features and new ideas should be in a separate branch that others can see, but that won't have any effects on the current working version of the project.
* **Adding commits**
  * Make some changes to the project in the new branch to flesh things out and work towards your new feature. Well-labeled commits make it easy for everyone else to see what you're working on, how you're working on it, and what your end goal might be.
  * Use **short, meaningful** commit messages.
* **Opening a pull request**
  * Light a signal fire so everyone knows you want to discuss what you're working on.
* **Reviewing changes with everyone**
  * Pull requests are for discussions. Make sure everyone's opinions have been heard before moving too far ahead with something that constitutes a major project decision.
* **Deploying and testing**
  * Use GitHub to deploy your new feature and run tests before throwing the change into the working project source. Let everyone review the pieces and parts of your code if they'd like to. This is a final quality control check before making a direct alteration to the code that users will run.
* **Merging**
  * Changes verified? Add them to the production-level code.
  * Pull requests will maintain a history of the changes made to everything.
  
## Default Branch

The default branch for this project is set to **_develop_**. This means that all branches for new features will be created from and merged into this branch, **not the _master_ branch**. The **_master_** branch is reserved for the working, production-level source (once it exists).
  
This project is meant to be a learning experience. We're going to find some data worth analyzing, engineer a web application that can do something cool with it, and share it with the world.
